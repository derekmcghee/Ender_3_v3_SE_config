# Ender_3_v3_SE_config
My repo for my Klipper config setup. This repo uses 0xD34D's fork here on github for my Klipper install.

Hey and thanks for trying my shizzzy!

Few things to get you going, know whats going on, and links to documentations

I stole most of the config from the Oct 2023 Sonic Pad firmware patch
Creality released. They hid their Auto-Z Stuff pretty well, and currently this config is built using the fork of Klipper with it most implemented.

As of 11/23/2023 this build uses this fork

Thanks 0xD34D! And hope you saw my DM's on reddit. Sorry i was stoned and it looks like helpful shit. Hope it was.

His Klipper fork with LoadCell PR Touch Probe. His Configs are in a Seperate Repo!

I have 3-4 double sided buildsheets i rotate thru with various smooth/texture coatings. Well, This guy is a pretty bad ass Klipper guru i found on the interwebs, and he has created these Buildsheet macros that auto save any babystepping you happen to do during printing. If you own/use/know how Prusa's work with this, This is a implementation mirroring them.
Thanks for the baller ass work Garethky Not just on this, I see you king!

TLDR - IF YOU BABYSTEP YOUR Z AFTER YOUR PRINT BEGINS AND THESE MACROS ARE ENABLED, YOU DO NOT NEED TO SAVE THEM AT THE PRINT END, IF YOU DO, YOU WILL DOUBLE THE CHANGES. THEY ARE ALREADY SAVED.
