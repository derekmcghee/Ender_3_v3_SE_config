# Ender_3_v3_SE_config
My repo for my Klipper config setup. This repo uses 0xD34D's fork here on github for my Klipper install.

Hey and thanks for trying my shizzzy!

Few things to get you going, know whats going on, and links to documentations

I stole most of the config from the Oct 2023 Sonic Pad firmware release. The file was a clusterfuck.
So, I split the config in two parts, the second half is the macros that are useful outside of Sonic Pad.
I put them in the file CR_Macros.cfg. Side note, Assholes say its open source and use others code, but man
they hid their Auto-Z Stuff pretty well... So with that in mind, Know that this config is built 
for using a fork of Klipper that has it most implemented.

As of 11/23/2023 this build uses this fork from 0xD34D's repo! Ball out my guy! Good work!

Thanks 0xD34D! And hope you saw my DM's on reddit. Sorry i was really stoned at the moment....
and I KNOW I KNOW I SPAMMED 42 LINKS IM SORRY, BUt... it looked ike helpful shit. Hope it was =D

Link to his Klipper fork with LoadCell PRTouch Z Probe. His Configs are in a Seperate Repo!

KAMP is the best shit ive ever seeen. Dont question, just use it!

I have 3-4 double sided buildsheets i rotate thru with various smooth/texture coatings. Well, This guy is a pretty bad ass Klipper guru i found on the interwebs, and he has created these Buildsheet macros that auto save any babystepping you happen to do during printing. If you own/use/know how Prusa's work with this, This is a implementation mirroring them. Thanks for the baller ass work Garethky, and I dont mean just on this, I see you king, carryin us scrubs on ya back! Thanks!

TLDR - IF YOU BABYSTEP YOUR Z AFTER YOUR PRINT BEGINS AND THESE MACROS ARE ENABLED, YOU DO NOT NEED TO SAVE THEM AT THE PRINT END, IF YOU DO, YOU WILL DOUBLE THE CHANGES. THEY ARE ALREADY SAVED.

...ps - this dudes repos on git are a 3d printing nerd haven of well organized code and how shit works. 
Each repo is fucking huge and VERY GOOD stuff that helped me stumble thru how Klippers workflow functions.
Check em out!
